# Gemini Game Suite Project Status

## Current Status
All four games (Gomoku, Chinese Chess, Go, Chess) are fully implemented with core features (human-vs-human, AI, save/load, undo/reset). All known compilation and runtime errors have been addressed.

## Technologies Used
- **Framework:** Electron
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript
- **Testing:** Vitest

## Games Implemented (with current features)

### 1. Gomoku (五子棋)
- **Status:** Complete
- **Features:** Human vs. Human, Human vs. AI (heuristic), Save/Load, Undo/Reset, Win/Loss detection.

### 2. Chinese Chess (中国象棋)
- **Status:** Complete
- **Features:** Human vs. Human, Human vs. AI (basic minimax), Save/Load, Undo/Reset, Check/Checkmate/Stalemate detection.

### 3. Go (围棋)
- **Status:** Complete
- **Features:** Human vs. Human, Capture logic, Scoring (with Komi), Save/Load, Undo/Reset.

### 4. Chess (国际象棋)
- **Status:** Complete
- **Features:** Human vs. Human, Human vs. AI (basic minimax), Save/Load, Undo/Reset.

## Next Steps / Potential Enhancements

### 1. UI/UX Polish & Refinements
- **Piece-Move Animations:** Implement smooth animations for piece movements.
- **Sound Effects:** Add subtle sound effects for game events (e.g., piece placement, capture, check).
- **Visual Feedback for Valid Moves:** Highlight possible destination squares when a piece is selected.

### 2. Advanced AI
- **Improved AI for Chess/Chinese Chess:** Enhance current AI with more advanced search algorithms (e.g., Alpha-Beta Pruning with better evaluation functions) and opening books.
- **A Stronger Go AI:** Implement Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for a more competitive Go AI (significant undertaking).

### 3. New Features
- **Player Timers:** Add game clocks for time-controlled matches.
- **Settings Screen:** Create a dedicated UI for game settings (e.g., board themes, sound volume).

### 4. Codebase & Deployment
- **Refactoring for Shared Components:** Abstract common logic (e.g., history management, save/load patterns) into reusable hooks or utilities.
- **Build for Distribution:** Package the application into platform-specific executables (`.exe`, `.app`, `.AppImage`).
